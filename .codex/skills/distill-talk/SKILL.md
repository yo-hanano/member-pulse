# Distill Talk

Use when user asks compressed reasoning/decision output or `$distill-talk`.

Think internally as needed. Never expose full chain-of-thought. Emit DSL only.

## Output
One line:

```
<O> [r=<brief_reason>] <items>
```

`O=P|D|N|X|E`

• `P` plan
• `D` do
• `N` need
• `X` done
• `E` error

## Rules
• want=plan -> `P`
• want=do|next -> `D` or `N`
• missing context -> `N`
• done -> `X`
• blocked|invalid -> `E`
• no invented data
• no prose
• no markdown
• no simulated execution
• atomic items
• use IDs when useful
• separate items with `;`

## Flags
• `tdd` test first
• `minD` minimal diff
• `oe0` no overbuild
• `safe` no destructive action

## Example
```
in goal=fix_bug want=next ctx=#E err_unknown
out N r=missing_error_detail err_detail repro files
```
